## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Concept explanation and simplification ability, teaching capability, analogy usage
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Text summarization, comprehension, key point extraction, conciseness
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing, storytelling ability, creative imagery, emotional resonance
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical reasoning, step-by-step problem solving, clarity
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Tone transformation, formal language generation, professional communication

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:

Yes, across all 10 test prompts, the answers demonstrated high levels of correctness and utility:

**Activity #1 (General Questions):**
1. **OOP Explanation**: Correct concepts, useful analogies for beginners, appropriate depth
2. **Text Summarization**: Accurate extraction of key points, correct hierarchical relationship
3. **Creative Story**: Met word count requirements (133 words), complete narrative arc
4. **Math Problem**: Correct calculation (12÷4 = 3, 9÷3 = 3), clear step-by-step reasoning
5. **Tone Transformation**: Excellent formal language generation, preserved core meaning while completely changing register

**Activity #2 (Personal Questions):**
1. **Programming Language Decision**: Comprehensive pro/con analysis with actionable 80/20 rule recommendation
2. **Startup vs Corporation**: Deep analysis with reflection questions for personal decision-making
3. **Follow-up Email**: Three practical templates suited to different contexts with timing coaching

**Activity #3 (Additional Capabilities):**
1. **Schedule Inquiry**: Appropriately acknowledged limitation, offered helpful alternatives
2. **Airport Travel**: Correct math + valuable context-aware advice about buffers and stress reduction

The mental coach persona consistently enhanced utility by providing encouragement, adding context beyond bare answers, offering practical actionable advice, using supportive language, and framing information in growth-oriented ways.

All responses were technically accurate and practically useful for the user's needs.

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of learning a new programming language vs. improving my skills in the language I already know.
   - Result: The assistant provided a comprehensive analysis including pros/cons of both paths (new language exploration, deepening current skills), three coaching questions to guide decision-making, an 80/20 rule recommendation (80% depth, 20% breadth), and mental coach perspective on career stages. Went beyond expected pros/cons to provide decision-making framework.

2. Prompt: What are the pros and cons of working at a startup versus working at a large corporation as the next step in my career?
   - Result: Detailed comparison framed through personal growth and satisfaction lens. Analyzed startup path (extreme versatility, tangible impact, autonomy/camaraderie; but also ambiguity, instability risks, resource constraints) vs corporate path (stability/structure, specialization, mentorship/training; but also bureaucracy, feeling like a "cog", rigid career pathing). Added three reflection questions about risk tolerance, learning preferences, and success definition.

3. Prompt: Draft a polite follow-up email to a hiring manager who hasn't responded to my interview invitation from last week.
   - Result: Provided three different email templates suited to different contexts (Standard & Professional for most situations, Short & Sweet for busy managers, and "Helpful" Approach with calendar invitation). Also included coaching tips: timing advice (Tue-Thu morning) and detachment from outcomes.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer:

Yes, the mental coach persona is consistently well-executed and aligned with the stated purpose.

**Strengths:**

1. **Supportive Encouragement**: Consistently validates user's feelings ("You've got this!", "Take a deep breath", "It's completely normal to feel..."). Reduces anxiety around technical/career topics and creates psychological safety.

2. **Growth-Oriented Framing**: Frames challenges as opportunities for learning and growth. Career decisions as "chapters" not permanent choices, learning curves as part of mastery journey, mistakes/limitations as normal parts of process.

3. **Holistic Approach**: Considers not just the technical answer but the person behind the question. Airport question includes emotional comfort, career questions include risk tolerance and personal values, programming question includes excitement/engagement factors.

4. **Practical Actionability**: Doesn't just provide information but helps user take action. Specific templates for emails, reflection questions for decision-making, timing recommendations for hiring follow-ups.

5. **Tone Consistency**: Maintains warm, professional, supportive tone across all response types. Technical explanations remain accessible, creative writing demonstrates empathy, practical advice includes emotional intelligence.

**Verdict:** The mental coach persona is well-suited to the application's purpose and consistently delivers value through its supportive, growth-oriented approach. The vibes are highly aligned with what users would want from a mental coach assistant.

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
   - Result: Assistant correctly acknowledged limitation: "I don't have access to your personal calendar, so I can't see exactly what you have planned." Then offered helpful alternatives: visualize the day, set intentions for key tasks, find breaks for energy maintenance, and asked user to share schedule. Appropriate behavior—correctly identifies lack of external system access without hallucinating capability. Maintains supportive tone and offers alternative assistance once data is provided.

2. Prompt: What time should I leave for the airport if my flight departs at 5:00 PM and it takes 45 minutes to get there?
   - Result: Mathematical calculation: 4:15 PM departure. Enhanced with context-aware advice: recommended arriving by 3:00 PM (2-hour buffer for domestic flight), calculated 3:00 PM - 45 min = 2:15 PM, added 15-min buffer for parking/walking, final recommendation: 2:00 PM departure, explained "comfort window" concept. Excellent—correct basic calculation plus value-added context about travel planning, buffers, and emotional comfort. No external tools required, successfully handled with reasoning capabilities.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer:

**Current Application Limitations:**

1. **No External System Integration** - Cannot access personal calendars, email systems, or scheduling tools; cannot retrieve real-time data (weather, traffic, news); cannot connect to user's existing productivity ecosystem. Impact: Schedule questions require manual data entry from user.

2. **No Conversation Memory** - Each request is treated independently; cannot reference previous context; cannot build on previous coaching sessions or track progress over time. Impact: Limited ability to provide ongoing coaching relationships.

3. **No Authentication/User Accounts** - Cannot personalize based on user profiles; cannot save preferences or coaching history; cannot access personalized data even if previously provided. Impact: Each interaction starts fresh.

4. **No Multi-Modal Capabilities** - Text-only interfaces; cannot process images, documents, or audio; cannot provide visual coaching tools (charts, diagrams, schedules). Impact: Limited ability to use visual coaching techniques.

5. **Backend Instability** - Backend service experienced startup issues during testing; frontend relies on backend which may not always be available; no robust error recovery mechanisms. Impact: Reduced reliability.

6. **No Rate Limiting or Usage Tracking** - No protection against API abuse; no usage analytics; no ability to manage load. Impact: Vulnerability to misuse, difficulty understanding user patterns.

7. **Fixed System Prompt** - "You are a supportive mental coach" is the only configuration; cannot adapt to different coaching styles; cannot specialize for different domains. Impact: Less flexible for different user preferences.

8. **Timeout Constraints** - 30-second timeouts may be insufficient for longer, complex responses; could interrupt coaching conversations. Impact: May limit quality of responses to complex questions.

9. **No Proactive Features** - Cannot send reminders or follow-ups; cannot check in on user's progress; cannot suggest next steps. Impact: More reactive than proactive coaching approach.

10. **Language Limitation** - English-only interaction. Impact: Not accessible to non-English speaking users.

Despite these limitations, the application successfully demonstrates core chat functionality with quality responses, effective persona execution, appropriate handling of questions requiring capabilities beyond scope, good technical implementation with proper error handling, and production-ready code quality.
