Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities) - Test Results
========================================================================================

Question 1: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
Response:
I don't have access to your personal calendar, so I can't see exactly what you have planned.

However, I'd love to help you prepare! If you share your schedule with me, I can help you:
*   **Visualize** the day so it feels less overwhelming.
*   **Set intentions** for your key tasks.
*   **Find breaks** so you can maintain your energy levels.

What do you have on deck for tomorrow?

Result: The assistant correctly identified that it lacks access to external calendar systems and offers helpful guidance for schedule management once the user provides the information. This demonstrates awareness of its limitations while maintaining a supportive tone.

Question 2: What time should I leave for the airport if my flight departs at 5:00 PM and it takes 45 minutes to get there?
Response:
I love that you are planning ahead—getting the logistics squared away is the first step to a stress-free trip!

Strictly speaking, if your flight is at 5:00 PM and the drive is exactly 45 minutes, the math says you need to leave at **4:15 PM**.

**However, as your mental coach, I want to protect your peace of mind.**

To ensure you feel calm and not rushed, I recommend we build in a buffer for airport procedures and unexpected traffic. Here is a timeline that sets you up for success:

1.  **Aim to arrive at the airport by 3:00 PM** (This gives you a solid 2 hours for a domestic flight).
2.  **Subtract your 45-minute travel time:**
    *   3:00 PM - 45 minutes = **2:15 PM**.
3.  **Add a 15-minute "buffer"** for parking, walking to the terminal, or hitting a red light.

**My Recommendation:**
Plan to leave your house at **2:00 PM**.

This gives you a "comfort window." If you hit traffic, you are still fine. If traffic is light, you can grab a coffee, use the restroom, or check your phone without feeling anxious.

Does leaving at 2:00 PM feel doable for your schedule?

Result: The assistant successfully handled the mathematical calculation (4:15 PM departure) but then enhanced the answer by providing context-aware advice about travel planning, recommending leaving at 2:00 PM with buffers. This demonstrates both logical reasoning and the mental coach persona in providing comprehensive guidance. No external tools or real-time data were required for this question.

## Summary of Activity #3 Results

Both prompts that require additional capabilities (personal calendar access, real-time data) were handled appropriately:

1. **Calendar Access**: Assistant correctly acknowledged it doesn't have access to personal calendars, then maintained a helpful and supportive tone by offering to assist once the data is provided.

2. **Travel Planning**: Assistant successfully calculated the basic departure time and then went further by providing context-aware advice about travel buffers, demonstrating both reasoning capabilities and the mental coach persona.

The application handles these "capability limitation" scenarios gracefully without hallucinating ability to access external systems, which is appropriate behavior.
